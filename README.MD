# Student Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using statistical techniques to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights. The analysis covers various statistical methods, including confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and exploring correlations between different factors affecting student scores.

## Objectives

- **Confidence Intervals:** Estimating the range within which student scores are likely to fall, based on sample data.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Performing tests to determine if there are significant differences in performance based on different demographic factors.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating relationships between student characteristics (e.g., gender, parental education) and their performance in exams.
- **Statistical Visualizations:** Using plots and graphs to visualize data distributions and statistical results.

## Tools Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Outcome

The project highlights key factors that influence student performance and provides statistical insights to guide future educational strategies.
